# A place to practice coding!

"This is a place where I record the problems I've solved on the Baekjoon Online Judge. 

I am steadily solving coding problems to improve my coding skills. Here, I’ve documented my approaches and what I’ve learned, so feel free to take a look. 

I solve around 10 to 20 problems each week, and I've organized them in a hierarchical directory by year, month, and day to make it easy to browse."
